# jsFracas
An open-source, HTML5 clone of OpenFracas

## Why jsFracas?
The game Open Fracas (which was an open-source clone of Fracas, which was basically a risk clone) was an amazing game, but had its issues.
Large maps were scaled down too much, saving/loading games never seemed to work, the AI was easy to overcome, etc. The game is still worth
playing, but has since been abandoned by its creator. To keep the game alive I decided to make an HTML5 port.

## Planned features
* 2D camera system
* State saving/loading via JSON for cross-machine save game sharing
* Map editor
* Up to 16 local human/AI players
* Multiple AI difficulties
* Random map generation
* Teams
